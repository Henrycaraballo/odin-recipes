        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Homemade Apple Pie</h3>
            <p>A family favorite. The very best apple pie you have ever tasted, with a buttery, flaky, homemade, rolling pie crust, and a filling with a mix of different types of tasty apples, spices, vanilla and a splash of brandy.</p>
        <h2>The Best Apples for Apple Pie</h2>
            <p>It´s best to use a mix of different types of apples in your pie. Some apple varieties cook up faster than others. Some cook up firm, smoe more soft; some apples are more tart, some more sweet.</p>
            <p>By commbining them, you´ll get a more complex, deeper flavor. Look for a combination of tart and sweet apples, and a combination of apples that cook up firm and soft. That said, some apples are better for cooking into a pie than others. Try these:</p>

            <p><strong>Avoid Red Delicious apples for pies, they don´t cook well.</strong></p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <h4></h4>
            <h5>The Perfect Pie Crust</h5>
              <p>The most forgiving pie crust is one that is made with a mixture of butter and shortening. That way you get the flavor of the butter, with the easy flakiness that comes from using shortening.</p>
              <p>Some people use all vegetable oil, and some swear by lard. A favorite one is made with <em>sour-cream</em> as the fat, along with butter. No need for a food processor; the dough is easy to roll-out, and the crust is wonderfully flaky.</p>
            <h5>Mix the flour, sugar, and salt:</h5>    
              <p>Pour flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a couple of times to mix.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds good cooking apples (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of the apples)</li>

            <li>1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet your like your pie</li>
