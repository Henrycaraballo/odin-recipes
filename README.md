# odin-recipes

This project is designed to build my html development experience.  The site will contain a homepage with some recipes listed.  

I have organized the project as a portfolio repository on Github, cloned it with the Ubuntu cmd terminal and used VSC to write this readme message.  

The design is basic, without much color or structure to it, but will improve in followup projects.
