# odin-recipes : 

This project is designed to build my html development experience.  

The site will contain a homepage with some recipes listed. 

I have organized the project as a portfolio repository on Github, cloned it with the Ubuntu cmd terminal and used VSC to write this readme message.  

The design will be basic, without color or much structure to it, but it will improve with followup projects.
