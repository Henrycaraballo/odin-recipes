# odin-recipes : 

This project is designed to build my html development experience.  

The site will contain a homepage with some recipes listed. 

I have organized the project as a portfolio repository on Github, cloned it with the Ubuntu cmd terminal and used VSC to write this readme message.  

The design will be basic, without color or much structure to it, but it will improve with followup projects.

I referenced three recipe html pages to the index.html homepage for this project, each one using the html "target" and "rel" elements to control and protect each hyperlink.

Each recipe html page contains a reference hyperlink of the content source, recipe image, description, instruction and ingredients list. 

Finally, the folder directory and files have been organized to provide a clear understanding of the project learning experience and exercise.  

Once this part of the development learning process is complete, I will move to building an app.
